# Description

  Simplified shell is a project developed for OS classes. It was the last activity
proposed by the professor and the main reason is to learn more about UNIX and its 
peculiarities.

## Usage

  For simple usage, just compile the `sshell.c` file and have fun. You can initialize
the shell with a path working directory just passing it how first argument.

## Observations

  - Commands that are built into shells wasn't implemented yet, just the binaries
are executed.

  - There is still a problem with memory leak because of a pointer reference lost 
in somewhere.
